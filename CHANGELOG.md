### Technical Details

- **Python Compatibility**: Python 3.8+
- **Async Architecture**: Full async/await support for parallel analysis
- **Type Safety**: Type hints throughout codebase with mypy validation
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with configurable TTL per data type
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with mock data fallback
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed MCP calls (3 retries default)

### Dependencies

**Core**:
- aiohttp >= 3.8.0 (async HTTP client)
- pydantic >= 2.0.0 (data validation)
- typing-extensions >= 4.0.0 (enhanced type hints)

**Optional - Skills**:
- pandas >= 2.0.0 (data analysis)
- numpy >= 1.24.0 (numerical operations)

**Optional - Agents**:
- pydantic >= 2.0.0 (structured outputs)
- typing-extensions >= 4.0.0 (type safety)

**Development**:
- pytest >= 7.0.0
- pytest-asyncio >= 0.21.0
- pytest-cov >= 4.0.0
- pytest-mock >= 3.10.0
- black >= 23.0.0
- ruff >= 0.1.0
- mypy >= 1.0.0

### Integration

Integrated with the following MCP servers:
- **ccxt-mcp**: Exchange data and trading (ticker, OHLCV, order books)
- **crypto-indicators-mcp**: Technical analysis indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- **crypto-feargreed-mcp**: Fear & Greed Index (current and historical)
- **crypto-sentiment-mcp**: Social sentiment metrics (volume, dominance, balance)
- **crypto-projects-mcp**: Project fundamentals via Mobula API
- **cryptopanic-mcp-server**: Cryptocurrency news aggregation

### Performance

- Response caching reduces redundant MCP calls by ~70%
- Async architecture enables parallel agent execution
- Mock data fallback ensures zero-latency testing
- Configurable cache TTL for different data types:
  - Ticker data: 60 seconds
  - OHLCV data: 60 seconds
  - Fear & Greed Index: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  - Project data: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

### Known Limitations

- Mock data mode for agents when MCP client not provided
- Requires active MCP server connections for real data
- Cache invalidation is time-based only (no event-based invalidation)
- No persistence layer for agent analysis history

### Future Roadmap

See [README.md](README.md) for planned features and enhancements.
