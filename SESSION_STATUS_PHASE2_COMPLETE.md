# Session Status Report: Phase 2 Complete, Phase 3 Blocked

## Completed Work

### ✅ Phase 2: VC Analyst API Contract Fixes
**Commit:** ab6d3a6 - "fix(tests): complete Phase 2 API contract fixes for VC analyst"

**Changes Made:**
1. `agents/crypto_vc_analyst.py` (line 469):
   - Added `"development_activity_tracking"` to capabilities list

2. `tests/test_agents/test_vc_analyst.py` (lines 51-52):
   - Changed assertion from `assert len(analyst.optional_servers) == 0`
   - To: `assert len(analyst.optional_servers) == 1  # github-manager is optional`
   - Added: `assert "github-manager" in analyst.optional_servers`

**Test Impact:** Should fix 2 of the 18 VC analyst test failures.

## Blocked Work

### ⏸️ Phase 3: Thesis Synthesizer API Contract Fixes

**Issue Encountered:** Edit tool / git / bash synchronization problem where:
- Edit tool shows changes in Read output
- But git diff doesn't detect them (CRLF normalization hash collision)
- Bash utilities (grep, sed, cat) can't see the changes either

**Workaround Attempted:**
- Used `sed` commands which git COULD detect
- But sed commands corrupted the file structure
- Edit tool then couldn't find strings to replace in corrupted file
- Restore operations didn't fully clean the working directory

**Required Changes for Phase 3:**

1. **agents/thesis_synthesizer.py - get_capabilities() method** (around line 485):
   ```python
   # Change domain
   "domain": "multi_domain_synthesis",  # OLD
   "domain": "strategic_orchestration",  # NEW

   # Replace entire capabilities list
   "capabilities": [
       "agent_orchestration",              # OLD
       "multi_domain_synthesis",           # OLD
       "conflict_resolution",              # OLD
       "thesis_generation",                # OLD
       "investment_recommendations",       # OLD
   ],
   # With:
   "capabilities": [
       "comprehensive_analysis_orchestration",  # NEW
       "conflict_detection_resolution",         # NEW
       "investment_thesis_generation",          # NEW
       "weighted_signal_synthesis",             # NEW
   ],

   # Add these two new fields after capabilities
   "required_mcps": [],  # Orchestrator delegates to specialized agents
   "optional_mcps": [],  # Orchestrator delegates to specialized agents
   ```

2. **agents/thesis_synthesizer.py - detect_conflicts() method** (around lines 574-586):
   ```python
   # Change severity values
   "severity": "high"      →  "severity": "major"
   "severity": "medium"    →  "severity": "moderate"
   ```

3. **agents/thesis_synthesizer.py - resolve_conflicts() method** (around line 590):
   ```python
   # Current signature (from commit 9168abf)
   async def resolve_conflicts(
       self,
       conflicts: List[Dict[str, str]],
   ) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:

   # Change to:
   async def resolve_conflicts(
       self,
       conflicts: List[Dict[str, str]],
       macro_analysis: Dict,
       fundamental_analysis: Dict,
       sentiment_analysis: Dict,
   ) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
   ```

4. **agents/thesis_synthesizer.py - synthesize_investment_thesis() convenience function** (around line 607):
   ```python
   # Current signature
   async def synthesize_investment_thesis(
       asset: str = "BTC",
       horizon_days: int = 30,
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:

   # Change to:
   async def synthesize_investment_thesis(
       asset: str = "BTC",
       horizon_days: int = 30,
       macro_analyst: CryptoMacroAnalyst = None,
       vc_analyst: CryptoVCAnalyst = None,
       sentiment_analyst: CryptoSentimentAnalyst = None,
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """
       ...existing docstring...
       """
       synthesizer = ThesisSynthesizer(
           macro_analyst=macro_analyst,
           vc_analyst=vc_analyst,
           sentiment_analyst=sentiment_analyst,
       )
       return await synthesizer.generate_investment_thesis(asset, horizon_days)
   ```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Fix
User applies the changes listed above manually and commits.

### Option 2: New Session
Start fresh session with working tools to complete Phase 3.

### Option 3: Run Tests First
Run the test suite to see exactly which tests still fail:
```bash
pytest tests/test_agents/test_thesis_synthesizer.py -v
```

This will show precisely which fixes are needed vs. which may already be in place from previous commits.

## Test Metrics

**Starting Point:** 78 test failures
**After Phase 1 (previous session):** ~66 failures (12 sentiment analyst fixes)
**After Phase 2 (this session):** ~64 failures (2 VC analyst fixes)
**After Phase 3 (pending):** Target ~58 failures (6 thesis synthesizer fixes)

**Total Expected Fix Count:** 20 API contract failures resolved (Phase 1 + 2 + 3)
**Remaining:** ~58 failures from other issues (enum contradictions, missing fields, etc.)
