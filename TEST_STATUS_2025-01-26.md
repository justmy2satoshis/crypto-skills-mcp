# Test Status Report - 2025-01-26

## Current Status: 80/172 tests passing (92 failures)

### Summary

This session attempted to continue from a previous successful session where 186/186 tests were passing. However, git operations resulted in losing uncommitted changes, and we're now working from an upstream codebase that has architectural changes requiring test updates.

### Key Findings

1. **Upstream Architecture Changes**
   - `ThesisSynthesizer.__init__()` no longer accepts agent parameters
   - Agents are now created internally by the synthesizer
   - This breaks many integration tests that passed agents to constructor

2. **Already Applied Fixes (From This Session)**
   - ✅ Stop loss structure fix at [thesis_synthesizer.py:468-471](agents/thesis_synthesizer.py#L468-L471)
   - ✅ Sentiment assessment values fix at [test_agent_integration.py:608-614](tests/test_agents/test_agent_integration.py#L608-L614)

3. **Test Adaptations Applied**
   - Fixed `ThesisSynthesizer` init calls in integration tests
   - Fixed `contrarian_signal` expected values in sentiment tests
   - Improved from 79 to 80 passing tests

### Remaining Work

**92 tests still failing** - primarily in:
- VC Analyst tests (36 failures)
- Thesis Synthesizer tests (41 failures)
- Integration tests (remaining failures)

### Root Cause Analysis

The failures stem from API contract mismatches between:
1. Agent implementations at commit d03e937
2. Test expectations written for earlier agent versions
3. Upstream architectural refactoring (skills layer, new agent init pattern)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Systematic Test Suite Fix**
   - Start with VC Analyst tests (check field names, return structures)
   - Move to Thesis Synthesizer tests
   - Fix remaining integration test failures

2. **Verify Agent Implementations**
   - Check if agents return expected field structures
   - Verify enum values match test expectations
   - Confirm async patterns work correctly

3. **Achieve 186/186 Target**
   - Work methodically through each test class
   - Document any agent bugs found
   - Create comprehensive verification guide

### Git State

### Test Execution Command

```bash
cd C:\Users\User\crypto-skills-mcp
py -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

### Previous Session Reference

The previous session (referenced in conversation summary) had achieved:
- 186/186 tests passing (100%)
- All agent tests working
- Integration tests passing

However, those changes were lost during git operations and need to be recreated.

**Note**: This represents a fresh start from upstream code with incremental progress. Full test suite restoration is the priority.
