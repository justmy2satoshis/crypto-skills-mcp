## Fixes Applied to Thesis Synthesizer

### Fix 1: Line 185 - Fundamental Recommendation Access
**File**: `agents/thesis_synthesizer.py:185`

**Problem**: TypeError when accessing nested dict field that doesn't exist
```python
# BEFORE:
fundamental_signal = fundamental["recommendation"]["action"]

# AFTER:
fundamental_signal = fundamental["recommendation"]
```

**Reason**: VC analyst returns `recommendation` as a simple string ("buy"), not a dict with `action` field

**Impact**: This error appeared in 10+ tests, should resolve many failures

---

### Fix 2: Line 584 - Severity Value
**File**: `agents/thesis_synthesizer.py:584`

**Problem**: Invalid severity value
```python
# BEFORE:
"severity": "high",

# AFTER:
"severity": "major",
```

**Reason**: Test expects severity in `["minor", "moderate", "major"]` not "high"

**Impact**: 1 test failure

---

### Fix 3: Line 524 - Domain Field
**File**: `agents/thesis_synthesizer.py:524`

**Problem**: Wrong domain value in get_capabilities
```python
# BEFORE:
"domain": "multi_domain_synthesis",

# AFTER:
"domain": "strategic_orchestration",
```

**Reason**: Test expects `"strategic_orchestration"` as the orchestrator's domain

**Impact**: 1 test failure

---

### Fix 4: Lines 525-530 - Capabilities List
**File**: `agents/thesis_synthesizer.py:525-530`

**Problem**: Wrong capability names
```python
# BEFORE:
"capabilities": [
    "agent_orchestration",
    "multi_domain_synthesis",
    "conflict_resolution",
    "thesis_generation",
    "investment_recommendations",
],

# AFTER:
"capabilities": [
    "comprehensive_analysis_orchestration",
    "conflict_detection_resolution",
    "weighted_signal_synthesis",
    "investment_thesis_generation",
],
```

**Reason**: Test checks for specific capability names that match the orchestrator's actual functions

**Impact**: 1 test failure

---

### Fix 5: Lines 536-537 - Required/Optional MCPs
**File**: `agents/thesis_synthesizer.py:536-537`

**Problem**: Missing fields in get_capabilities
```python
# ADDED:
"required_mcps": [],  # Orchestrator delegates to specialized agents
"optional_mcps": [],
```

**Reason**: Test checks for these fields. Orchestrator doesn't directly use MCPs, it delegates to specialized agents

**Impact**: 2 test failures

---

### Fix 6: Lines 637-663 - Conflict Resolution Field Names
**File**: `agents/thesis_synthesizer.py:637-663`

**Problem**: Wrong field names in resolution dictionaries
```python
# BEFORE:
resolution = {
    **conflict,  # This spread "type", but test expects "conflict_type"
    "resolution": "...",
    "action": "...",
}

# AFTER:
resolution = {
    "conflict_type": conflict_type,
    "description": conflict.get("description", ""),
    "severity": severity,
    "resolution_strategy": "...",
    "final_decision": "...",
    "rationale": "...",
}
```

**Changes**:
- `type` → `conflict_type`
- `resolution` → `resolution_strategy`
- `action` → `final_decision`
- Added `rationale` field with explanation

**Reason**: Test expects these exact field names with rationale for the resolution

**Impact**: Multiple test failures in conflict resolution tests

---

### Fix 7: Lines 742-772 - Convenience Function Signature
**File**: `agents/thesis_synthesizer.py:742-772`

**Problem**: Function doesn't accept agent parameters
```python
# BEFORE:
async def synthesize_investment_thesis(
    asset: str = "BTC", horizon_days: int = 30
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    synthesizer = ThesisSynthesizer()
    return await synthesizer.generate_investment_thesis(asset, horizon_days)

# AFTER:
async def synthesize_investment_thesis(
    asset: str = "BTC",
    horizon_days: int = 30,
    macro_analyst=None,
    vc_analyst=None,
    sentiment_analyst=None,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    synthesizer = ThesisSynthesizer(
        macro_analyst=macro_analyst,
        vc_analyst=vc_analyst,
        sentiment_analyst=sentiment_analyst,
    )
    return await synthesizer.generate_investment_thesis(asset, horizon_days)
```

**Reason**: Test passes pre-instantiated agent instances to the convenience function

**Impact**: 1 test failure

---

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes
- 25 passed, 16 failed

### After Fixes (Expected)
- Significant reduction in failures
- Key areas addressed:
  - get_capabilities structure (3-5 tests)
  - conflict resolution (multiple tests)
  - convenience function (1 test)
  - fundamental recommendation access (10+ tests)
  - severity value (1 test)

### Remaining Work
- Run full test suite to verify fixes
- Address any remaining failures
- Fix 1 integration test failure
- Achieve 186/186 tests passing

## Next Steps

1. Run thesis synthesizer tests to verify fixes
2. Investigate any remaining failures
3. Run full test suite (all agents + integration)
4. Address integration test failure
5. Final verification: 186/186 tests passing
