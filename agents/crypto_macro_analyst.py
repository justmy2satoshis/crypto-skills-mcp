Crypto Macro Analyst Agent

Specialized Agent for macroeconomic analysis of cryptocurrency markets.

This Agent provides:
- Macro regime assessment (risk-on/risk-off sentiment)
- Central bank policy impact analysis
- Institutional flow tracking (ETF flows, exchange volume trends)
- Cross-asset correlation analysis
- Macro condition synthesis for investment timing

Data Sources:
- grok-search-mcp: Real-time news and economic data
- perplexity: Economic research and analysis
- etf-flow-mcp: Bitcoin/Ethereum ETF flow data
- ccxt-mcp: Exchange volume and institutional indicators

Strategic Value:
- Identifies optimal market entry/exit timing based on macro conditions
- Assesses risk sentiment regime changes
- Tracks institutional capital flows
- Provides context for investment decisions
