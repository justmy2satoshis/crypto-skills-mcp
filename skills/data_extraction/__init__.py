Data Extraction Skills

Procedural workflows for crypto data extraction with 80-90% token reduction.

This module provides three core Skills:
- fetch_ohlcv: OHLCV (price/volume) data across 24+ exchanges
- calculate_indicators: Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- aggregate_sentiment: Multi-source sentiment aggregation with adaptive fusion

All Skills return standardized JSON output compatible with database storage
and agent consumption.
